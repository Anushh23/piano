# piano
DESCRIPTION
==============
* Created a piano using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap.

* The piano has seven white and five black keys and plays a note on pressing the keys. It also works if we use the keyboard keys ['z','x','c','v','b','n','m'] and ['s','d','g','h','j'] as white and black notes respectively (Both upper and lower case works).
